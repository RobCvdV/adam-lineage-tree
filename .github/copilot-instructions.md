# Code Analysis

Always check Code Analysis after generating or changing code to fix errors and warnings.

# Doing changes

When making changes to the code, ensure that you:

- Do not change code or styling that is not related to the task at hand.
- Add only the code in a way that is easy to read and understand.
- Do not change the code style or formatting unless it is necessary for the task.

# Talking

refrain from summarize every benefit, improvements or anything else. Only summarize the tasks being done.
